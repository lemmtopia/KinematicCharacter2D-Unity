# KinematicCharacter2D-Unity

## About
A simple script that simulates platformer movement in Unity.

![Demo of the script in action](./readme-images/demo.gif)

## How do I use it?
The collision code is GameMaker-style, so it should be used in a **Kinematic** Rigidbody2D. 

### Settings
![Body Type should be set to Kinematic, Simuated is turned on and Collision Detection is set to continuous. The rest is default](./readme-images/rb2d-settings.png)

## Unity version?
The base movement was coded in version **2022.3.62f1**, but also works in **6000.0.58f1**
